    <p>Scallion pancakes are a staple in Chinese cuisine. These pancakes are thin, crisp and flakey from the laminated dough. While they are a little labor intensive to make, the delicate and aromatic flavor of green onion make it worth all the hard work.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Dough</h3>
        <li>2 cups (300 g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cool water</li>
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <li>1/4 cup + 2 tbs (50 g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup oil</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>8 to 10 green onions , split down the middle and chopped (yield 1 cup)</li>
        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <li>Oil for pan frying</li>
        <h3>Dipping Suce (Optional)</h3>
        <li>1 1/2 tbs soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbs Black Vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the flour and salt in a big bowl. Stir to mix well. Slowly drizzle in the hot water while mixing it with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork), until the water is fully absorbed. Slowly drizzle in the cool water, continuing to stir until many dough flakes form. Press the dough together, and try to combine the wet dough with the dry flour. Drizzle in a little extra water if there is any dry flour remaining. Knead until a firm ball is formed, about 5 minutes. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>While the dough is resting, combine the flour, oil, and salt in a small bowl. Mix until a smooth paste is formed.</li>
        <li>If making the dipping sauce, combine all the ingredients with 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl and mix until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
        
        <li>When the dough is done resting, knead for another minute until it is smooth. Cut the dough into 6 even pieces, about 76 grams per piece. Form the dough into balls using your hands.</li>
        <li>Work on one dough ball at a time, covering the rest with plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Roll each dough ball into a thin rectangle with a rolling pin, aiming for around 6×10” (15×25 cm). Lift and turn the dough regularly as you roll it to prevent sticking. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling onto the dough and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon, leaving about 1” (2.5 cm) on top and the left end without the filling. Sprinkle 2 heaping tablespoons of green onions onto the paste, concentrating most of it towards one side of the length and one side of the width, creating a loose L shape.</li>
        <li>Begin rolling the dough from the longer side of the dough where the green onions are concentrated, until you have one long tube. Lightly flatten the tube using your hand. Pinch the side with more green onion to seal it. Take the sealed side and gently pull and roll it towards the unsealed side, using your hand to smooth out the dough to push any large air bubbles out. Tuck the loose end under the rolled bun. Gently press down on the round disk with your hand to seal the pancake.</li>
        <li>Set the formed pancake aside and cover it with plastic wrap. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until each pancake is ready.</li>

        <li>Roll each prepared pancake into a circle, about 7-8” (17-20 cm) wide. Flip and move it as you do to prevent sticking. Don’t worry if air bubbles burst through or some green onions fall out.</li>
        <li>If you plan to store the pancakes and cook them later, place each pancake onto a piece of parchment paper and stack them. Transfer the pancakes to a large ziplock bag, squeeze out as much air as possible, and seal the bag. You can freeze the pancakes for up to 3 months.</li>
        <li>Heat a 9” (23 cm) cast iron pan (or a nonstick skillet) over medium-high heat and add enough oil to fully coat the bottom. Once the oil is hot, add a pancake. Use a pair of chopsticks (or a spatula) to swirl the pancake around to spread the oil and prevent sticking, for a few seconds. Cover the pan and turn the heat down to medium. Let the pancake cook, covered, for 1 minute. Remove the lid and flip the pancake, cover, and cook for another minute. Remove the lid. Use a spatula to press the pancake, to ensure even browning. Continue to cook, flipping regularly, until both sides are crisp and browned, about 3 minutes. Turn to medium-low heat if the pan gets too hot. Transfer the pancake to a cooling rack or a cutting board to cool. Repeat to cook all the pancakes you plan to serve.</li>
        <li>Once the pancakes are slightly cooled enough to handle, cut into 6 pieces and transfer to a serving platter. Serve hot with the dipping sauce as an appetizer.</li>

        <li>If cooking from frozen, let pancakes thaw for 10 minutes then proceed from step 8.</li>
