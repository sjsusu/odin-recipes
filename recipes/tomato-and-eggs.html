    <p>Tomato and Eggs is a common Chinese dish beloved by many. This meal can be made simply with just a few ingredients. Accompanied with a side of rice, the comforting dish is a symphony of flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1 lb. of Tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>4 Cloves of Garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp. of Sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbs of Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, a pinch each of salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>In a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add whisked eggs and use a spatula to form large curds, cooking until eggs are mostly cooked, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer eggs to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Return skillet to medium heat, adding a touch more oil if pan is dry. Add garlic and stir until lightly golden, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, teaspoon salt, pepper, and sugar. Then increase heat to medium-high. Stirring occasionally, cook until tomatoes are soft and half-disintegrated and juices thicken slightly to a saucy consistency, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return eggs back into the pan, then remove from heat. Stir to thoroughly combine tomatoes and eggs.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice.</li>
    </ol>
